# JavaScript-ES6-Course
Free JavaScript-ES6 online course from Rocketseat.com.br;

The course consists of several challenges about concepts of ES6+, Async/await and Webpack Pack Server.
By the end, we did an small final project which consists of an application that searches through github repositories and create dynamic lists using all the knowledge gained from the course. The application has several features like loading messages, use of async methods, axios, error messages, creating dynamic lists and more!
